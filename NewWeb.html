The analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points
in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference. The obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points
in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent
observations are independent and identically distributed. The systematic approach by which one goes about answering the mathematical and statistical
questions posed by these time correlations is commonly referred to as time
series analysis.
The impact of time series analysis on scientific applications can be partially documented by producing an abbreviated listing of the diverse fields
in which important time series problems may arise. For example, many familiar time series occur in the field of economics, where we are continually
exposed to daily stock market quotations or monthly unemployment figures.
ments. An epidemiologist might be interested in the number of influenza cases
observed over some time period. In medicine, blood pressure measurements
traced over time could be useful for evaluating drugs used in treating hypertension. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain-wave time series
patterns might be used to study how the brain reacts to certain stimuli under
various experimental conditions.
Many of the most intensive and sophisticated applications of time series
methods have been to problems in the physical and environmental sciences.
This fact accounts for the basic engineering flavor permeating the language of
time series analysis. One of the earliest recorded series is the monthly sunspot
numbers studied by Schuster (1906). More modern investigations may center on whether a warming is present in global temperature measurements

The modeling of speech series is an important problem related to the efficient
transmission of voice recordings. Common features in a time series characteristic known as the power spectrum are used to help computers recognize and
translate speech. Geophysical time series such as those produced by yearly depositions of various kinds can provide long-range proxies for temperature and
rainfall. Seismic recordings can aid in mapping fault lines or in distinguishing
between earthquakes and nuclear explosions.
The above series are only examples of experimental databases that can
be used to illustrate the process by which classical statistical methodology
can be applied in the correlated time series framework. In our view, the first
step in any time series investigation always involves careful scrutiny of the
recorded data plotted over time. This scrutiny often suggests the method of
analysis as well as statistics that will be of use in summarizing the information
in the data. Before looking more closely at the particular statistical methods,
it is appropriate to mention that two separate, but not necessarily mutually
exclusive, approaches to time series analysis exist, commonly identified as the
time domain approach and the frequency domain approach.
The time domain approach is generally motivated by the presumption
that correlation between adjacent points in time is best explained in terms
of a dependence of the current value on past values. The time domain approach focuses on modeling some future value of a time series as a parametric
function of the current and past values. In this scenario, we begin with linear
regressions of the present value of a time series on its own past values and
on the past values of other series. This modeling leads one to use the results
of the time domain approach as a forecasting tool and is particularly popular
with economists for this reason.
One approach, advocated in the landmark work of Box and Jenkins (1970;
see also Box et al., 1994), develops a systematic class of models called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to handle timecorrelated modeling and forecasting. The approach includes a provision for
treating more than one input series through multivariate ARIMA or through
transfer function modeling. The defining feature of these models is that they
are multiplicative models, meaning that the observed data are assumed to
result from products of factors involving differential or difference equation
operators responding to a white noise input.
A more recent approach to the same problem uses additive models more
familiar to statisticians. In this approach, the observed data are assumed to
result from sums of series, each with a specified time series structure; for example, in economics, assume a series is generated as the sum of trend, a seasonal
effect, and error. The state-space model that results is then treated by making
judicious use of the celebrated Kalman filters and smoothers, developed originally for estimation and control in space applications. Two relatively complete
presentations from this point of view are in Harvey (1991) and Kitagawa and
Gersch (1996).</p>
